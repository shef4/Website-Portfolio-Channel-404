									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>I am a Computer Engineering student, Residential Advisor, and Machine Learning Research Assistant at Virginia Tech. In my spare time, I work as a Project Manager at Sk. a company I founded for content creation and collaberation with other creators. I also do freelance photography and software development. My background in IT was developed in high school and I started Sk. as a passion project to explore my love for creativity and art while also building professional skills such as project management and entrepreneurship.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Passions</h3>
									<p>I am driven to work hard because of my love for meeting and collaborating with people from around the world as well as learning new skills and gaining practical experience. I am also passionate about contributing to the advancement of technology through machine learning application and open source development.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Personal Achievements</h3>
									<p>While living in New York, I took the initiative to start the company Sk. A passion project of mine that has allowed me to follow my interest in art and content creation while also developing leadership, business, and communication skills. This company has given me the chance to see a community of unique creators and passionate individuals grow and develop through mini-projects, collaborations, and community interaction.</p>

									<p>I would also say my progress as a Junior software developer after High School. I was able to gain a strong foundation and well structured foundation in programming through a 3 year highSchool course in Java. After Highschool I grew my programming skills through passion projects like building a website and attending hackathons and practical application such as machine learning research.</p>
